# 💻 Employee Management System (Offline CRUD) 🚀

Welcome to my **Employee Management System**! This is a React-based application designed to manage team records efficiently. It works entirely offline using the browser's **Local Storage**, meaning your data stays safe even if you refresh the page! 💾

## 📝 Project Description
This project was built to master the core concepts of **React.js**. It allows users to perform Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data. No external database is needed, making it a perfect example of an offline-first admin dashboard. 🛠️

## ✨ Key Features
* **➕ Add Employees:** Register new team members with their name, email, salary, and status.
* **📂 Data Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to save data permanently in the browser.
* **✏️ Edit Mode:** Update existing employee details instantly.
* **🗑️ Record Management:** Delete individual records or use the **"Clear All"** button to reset the system.
* **📊 Dashboard Summary:** View total employee count and active status at a glance.
* **📱 Responsive Design:** Clean UI that looks great on all screens!
